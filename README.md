 Custom F Key Command Plugin

This plugin disables Minecraft’s default F key behavior (off-hand swapping) and replaces it with a custom command defined in the configuration file. Instead of swapping hands, pressing the F key will automatically run the specified command!
 Features:

    Disables the default F key hand-swap action.

    Runs any command you define in the config.yml when the F key is pressed.

    Example: command: /tp Notch will teleport you to the player “Notch” when pressing F.

    Perfect for customizing gameplay and creating unique key-based actions.

Use Cases:

    Triggering special abilities or effects,

    Running custom scripts or server-side events,

    Enhancing minigames with quick-access commands.
